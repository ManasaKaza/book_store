# Book Store

A book store website allows users to sell their used books, helping others find affordable options. Sellers can list their books securely, with access protected by JWT authentication.
Buyers can easily browse and add as many books as they want to their cart. To use the site, both sellers and buyers need to log in. The project is built using the MERN stack.
